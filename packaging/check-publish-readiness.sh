#
# Release pre-flight: prove the crates.io fanout can actually run.
#
# Four ways a release-day publish breaks, none of which any other gate
# catches, and all of which are silent until the fanout is already half done:
#
#   1. A crate was added to the workspace since the last release. Trusted
#      Publishing over OIDC cannot CREATE a brand-new crate name, so the very
#      first publish of a new crate must be done by hand, with a crates.io
#      Trusted Publishing entry added afterwards. The fanout job fails on it
#      otherwise — after publishing everything ordered before it.
#   2. A crate exists in the workspace but is missing from publish.yml's list,
#      so it silently never publishes. Downstream users then get a version
#      mismatch on `cargo install`.
#   3. A NEW inter-crate dependency edge was added that publish.yml's order
#      does not respect. cargo refuses to publish a crate whose path-dep
#      sibling is not yet on crates.io at the pinned version, so the run dies
#      partway with half the workspace released and no clean way back.
#   4. The version bump missed an inter-crate pin. Members depend on their
#      siblings as `keyroost-* = { path = ..., version = "X" }`; a pin left
#      at the OLD version either kills the fanout mid-run (the old version
#      of the sibling satisfies the pin, the new crate publishes against it,
#      later crates conflict) or quietly publishes a mixed-version dependency
#      graph to downstream `cargo install` users.
#
# (3) is the subtle one: every crate can already be published and the release
# still breaks, because what changed is the ORDER requirement, not the set.
# v0.7.7 added keyroost-resolve -> keyroost-openpgp and happened to be ordered
# correctly; nothing would have caught it if it had not been.
#
# Usage:
#   packaging/check-publish-readiness.sh [previous-tag] [--offline]
#
#   previous-tag  Release to diff the member list against.
#                 Defaults to the newest v* tag, which at pre-flight time is
#                 the last release (the new tag does not exist yet).
#   --offline     Skip the crates.io probes; still runs (2), (3) and (4).
#
# Exits non-zero on any problem, with the specific crate named.
